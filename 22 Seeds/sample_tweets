@amyreen_  Thank you. I absolutely needed these words. Love you a lot and your words are the best as usual. Thank you for everything little sister. \u2764
P.s. can you see how cute you are? U.U \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc9e
Just because you aren't little doesn't mean I am the little sister u.u Thank you though,from the bottom of my heart. \u2764
You know you are the little one here, even if your age is not and some of your thoughts too. But shh. You're the little one here. \ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc97
The thing is, everyone wants a rose but nobody likes to get hurt with thorns.\nBut the real beauty of roses is hidden in every little thorn. You can't appreciate this flower if you first don't appreciate the thorns. Because even if it seems hard,there is always a little space for your fingers,so you can't take the rose in your hands and keep it there no matter what. You just have to find the little spaces.\n\nI found you and you're not even that little. @nadiaa_di \ud83d\udc97

\"Sometimes pain becomes such a huge part in your life that you expect it to always be there, because you can't remember a time when it wasn't.  But then one day you feel something else,something that feels wrong, only because it's so unfamiliar.\nAnd in that moment, you realize you're happy. \"

ORA MI PARTE LA LACRIMA. Cosa posso dirti? \nSono due anni che mi sopporti, che ci sopportiamo, sono due anni che scleriamo per ogni cosa, due anni di  risate e pazzie.\nDue anni che ti rubo le crush, due anni passati a parlare  continuamente. Due anni e ne abbiamo passate tante. Due anni magici, veramente. Grazie per ogni cosa. Sono contenta di averti scritto in chat quel giorno. Sono contentissima di averlo fatto, perch\u00e9 sei stupenda e amorevole e tutto.
#Tantoamorepernoi <3
A TE PARTE LA LACRIMA,A ME CHE DOVREBBE PARTIRE? <3
Due anni fa nemmeno io avrei mai potuto pensare che saresti diventata una delle persone pi\u00f9 importanti della mia vita.\nUno dei pochi esseri umani che tollero e soprattutto qualcuno che riesce a capirmi e a leggermi dentro pi\u00f9 di molti altri che mi guardano in faccia tutti i giorni e restano indifferenti.\nSei meravigliosa. E te lo dico spesso,lo so,ma se potessi te lo ripeterei ogni minuto di ogni ora di ogni giorno.\nE SONO DUE ANNI.\nTu eri un cucciolo di foca quando ci siamo conosciute.Io parlavo di rado e odiavo parlare di me.E ora se non parliamo almeno venti volte al giorno ci preoccupiamo.\nE se non parliamo ci stelliniamo su twitter.Tanto per ricordarci a vicenda che ci siamo anche senza parlare. \nIn un modo o nell'altro,due anni fa ci siamo trovate,uno di sti giorni ci abbracceremo e...e magari tra dieci anni ci sposeremo no? U.U \nAnzi,andremo a vivere insieme,io tu e millemila dvd di serie tv che abbiamo gi\u00e0 visto o che devi vedere-ti dice nulla Buffy?- e di film,film a non finire perch\u00e9 sono quelli che ci hanno unite no? \nE avremmo una biblioteca gigantesca e gelato.Tanto gelato.\nE i Coldplay che aspettano un nostro cenno per suonare qualcosa.\n\nDue anni.\nDue anni di sclerare per teen wolf insieme.\nDue anni di dirti di guardare Buffy.\nDue anni di chiamate partite per sbaglio nel cuore della notte.\nDue anni che ci chiamiamo Sposa a vicenda. \nDue anni di esserci quando il resto del mondo ci butta via.\n\nGrazie di tutto. \u2665 @_giusyrestifo

This is a simple message that you all should understand.\nWe all had and have that moment when everything just sucks and you can't see any light in your darkness. \nAnd you think that nobody loves you or at least,not in the way you need to be loved.\nBut there is something that I've learned from my experiences and it is that you won't never find the right person who loves you the way you wanna be loved. And nobody will fill the emptiness that you feel.\nBecause the love you really need is from yourself.\nYou can fill the emptiness inside you by loving yourself.\nBe what you need you the most.\nSave yourself tha way you wanna be saved.\nLOVE YOURSELF.\nAlways.\n\u2665

How is he/she handling the loss of Sky?
@triumphwellness he's a little more clingy than usual, but seems ok. She wasn't that active since the new year so I guess he saw the decline the same as we did. Thanks \u2764\ufe0f
3 mile walk this morning followed by a nap. Tough life being a dog. This is why they call Dalmatians Velcro dogs... Why sleep next to you when they can sleep ON you?

@eatdatesnotmates the dosa batter I bought from Indian shop locally, they sell it frozen. Just cook on a tava. The filling is onions, pre-cooked potatoes and peas saut\u00e9ed in a little olive oil and spices \ud83d\ude01 I had our Indian friends show me how to make it years ago \ud83d\udc4d the batter is a little time intensive so easier to buy instead \ud83d\ude1d
Yeah homemade #vegan dosa!!! I love Indian cuisine!!!! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude01 #indiancuisine

Nice pic!
Getting back into food prep and having these #amazeballs on hand for busy weeks is essential! I rolled them in coconut, hemp hearts and cocoa. Not sure which is gonna be my favorite. Which would you try first?
It's a tortilla with hummus, lettuce, lentils, mushrooms, pico de gallo, tomato and vegan cheese #vegan #veganladieswholift #veganfoodporn #vegetarian #plantbuilt #plantbuilt #pkd #nomeatathlete #meatlessmonday #MeatFreeAthlete #foodporn #fitfluential #sweatpink

My first #chipotle! #vegan style with the sofritas. I enjoyed it but man I was not impressed afterwards when I found out the sodium content \ud83d\ude33 definitely an occasional treat not a weekly occurrence! Really wondering when the restaurants are going to wake up and realize food doesn't need tons of salt!

This is weird for me to write because this girly isn't my friend or anyone famous. She's just a normal girl that goes through hate, almost the entire time, because everyone believes her boyfriend is gay. Why is she my #wcw? Because she's still here and alive even though she could have either left Louis or done something even worse. I'm inspired by her strength to ignore the haters and the fact that she posts on instagram no matter what those shippers believe. I think she's a beautiful and smart girl. Meeting her would probably mean talking about Starbucks, I love Starbucks. @eleanorj92, don't let the haters bring you down. They aren't that important. \n#Elounour #EleanorCalder #LouisTomlinson #SorryNotSorry #OneDirection #ElounorIsReal #Ships #ElounorShippers #WomanCrushWednesday

My #mcm is @harrystyles for many, many, many reasons. Of course- he is a very handsome man but that isn't the reason that he is my mcm. He is my mcm because no matter how much fame he seems to achieve, he always has a heart of gold and stays in touch with himself. From all the fan experiences people have talked about, he cares a lot about his fans along with his family and friends. He is just a beautiful human being that doesn't deserve the hate he receives. Another reason is that he has this voice that just makes me want to be happier for myself. His voice is beautiful and I could spend a lifetime listening to him talk or sing. Wow. That sounds weird to say. But oh well. This man inspires me to be a better person and I'm glad that he was given the chance to sing his heart out. Don't ever give up. #HarryStyles #OneDirection #ManCrushMonday #StylesGirl #Babe #Bae #JustAFan #SeventeenMag #NiallHoran #LiamPayne #ZaynMalik #LouisTomlinson #ManCrushEveryday #Directioners #Directioner #OnTheRoadAgainTour #HS #Styles
So I decided to get on Snapchat and this happened...this is why I have no friends. #HippoStatus #Loner #LateNightWeirdness #ModelMaterial #SoSexy #Selfie #Snapchat
My #wcw is @taylorswift because she is literally the essence of beauty, intelligence, and kick ass. A lot of people won't agree with me for this opinion but I don't really care. I'm sticking by my opinion. Taylor is a caring human being and she DESERVES every good thing that goes her way. I look up to her in many ways but she is the reason that I became a better person. She's the reason that I'm not afraid to be fearless or speak now. So I'm glad I have Taylor Swift in my life (musically and as an idol) or I think I would be in a bad place. \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc98\n#BlankSpace #brits2015 #BritAwards #TaylorSwift #WomanCrushWednesday #BlankSpaceBrits #Swifties #MyBabe #TaylorSwiftBrits #1989Love

@mach_won awe, that's cute. Joshykins thinks a girl's cute! \ud83d\ude02 You're too much. How do you \"idk\" on if a girl is cute or not? Just do a \"yes or potato\". Like most guys when it comes to me. \ud83d\ude02
No Ima talking about trusting you lol. Nah this girl is bad
@mach_won Gasp! I'm a VERY trustworthy person. I'm hurt, Josh, very hurt. Lolx and how is she bad??
Loool, nah she's cute. But how you hurt
@mach_won awe, again, Joshykins thinks a girl is cuuuute! And you don't trust me besides a \"maybe, idk\" Lolx I'm just kidding you, Josh. I'm not hurt.
Oh ight lol

I can't expect YOU to think I'm beautiful if I don't think I'm beautiful. So maybe one day...when I truly believe that I'm beauiful...you'll be there. But a girl can only hope. And until then- that person stays a mystery. \ud83d\udc8b
The sass in this family is unbelieveable. This is my #wcw because i absolutely love her and the doctors were wrong: she lived past three months. She is six months and loves to pull hair, my hair actually. She's my healthy baby sister and I'm so glad Kara is in my life. I absolutely love her and know she's going to achieve great things when she gets older. Right now- we gotta get her to finally sit up and crawl. She's the main reason why I'm still holding on and trying my hardest. \u2764

Tootsie rollsssssssss.
Doesn't taste anything like your typical Belgian. Chocolatey (like a tootsie roll ), boozy, awesome winter beer. Cheers to @ellem724 for the suggestion.
Night before Krampus, 11.2% with cranberry, cinnamon, and ginger
Brooklyn Blast Imperial IPA... Seriously good.
Polish restaurant, Polish beer. Described as a pilsner with ample hops. I'm just calling it a pilsner.
where are u @atmospherix
Hourglass in Longwood
Actually...
@atmospherix yummy
A double IPA from the Netherlands. That's probably a first for me. Well balanced, not overly hoppy. Actually quite delicious.
Yeah you do, with ratings.
Ok please!
This was an Imperial IPA from Japan. Smelled skunky, tasted a little funky, but actually fell a bit flat on flavor.
Perfect. For the really good ones, just trail off and type nonsense.
@atmospherix yes please!
I need to start Instagramming more beer...
Getting derby with it... #latergram

Delicious Jimmy Hoppa DIPA @ Fat Point Brewing in Punta Gorda.... Still in shock a solid craft brewery is minutes from the small town I grew up in.
Yesssssssss! Last raffle of the evening and I won! #tagbeerfest

Ohai! #izeahq

Tootsie rollsssssssss.
Doesn't taste anything like your typical Belgian. Chocolatey (like a tootsie roll ), boozy, awesome winter beer. Cheers to @ellem724 for the suggestion.
Night before Krampus, 11.2% with cranberry, cinnamon, and ginger
Brooklyn Blast Imperial IPA... Seriously good.
Polish restaurant, Polish beer. Described as a pilsner with ample hops. I'm just calling it a pilsner.
where are u @atmospherix
Hourglass in Longwood
Actually...
@atmospherix yummy
A double IPA from the Netherlands. That's probably a first for me. Well balanced, not overly hoppy. Actually quite delicious.
Yeah you do, with ratings.
Ok please!
This was an Imperial IPA from Japan. Smelled skunky, tasted a little funky, but actually fell a bit flat on flavor.
Perfect. For the really good ones, just trail off and type nonsense.
@atmospherix yes please!
I need to start Instagramming more beer...
Getting derby with it... #latergram
#comeonback @atmospherix great beer awaits !
