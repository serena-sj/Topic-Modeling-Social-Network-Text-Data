Hi all,

I have been working on the topic wise categorization of any text into 22 different categories for the past three days.
I am glad to inform that i have a base model up and running!

The GDrive link to the code:

This is just a base model, i am working on the following stuff at present,
1. Increasing the vocabulary size
2. Improving the Clustering mechanism
3. Improving the text pre-processing
4. Trying to distinguish between the very close categories like (fashion and beauty; pop and music; etc)

PS: the difficulty am facing is mostly due to the unsupervised approach we are following, but will surely find a way out.

The base model is still working pretty well for some of the main categories!

PFA the screenshot of the working model.

Cheers,
Satish Palaniappan.
